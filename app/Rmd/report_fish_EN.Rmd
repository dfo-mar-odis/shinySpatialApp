Dataset description from the Open Data record [@OpenData_MAR_RV]: The Fisheries and Oceans Canada ecosystem Research Vessel (RV) surveys are conducted annually (since 1970) and are a source of integrated ecosystem monitoring data. These survey data are the primary data source for monitoring trends in species distribution, abundance, and biological condition within the region, and also provide data to the Atlantic Zonal Monitoring Program (AZMP) for monitoring hydrographic conditions, along with zooplankton and phytoplankton. The surveys follow a stratified random sampling design, and include sampling using a bottom otter trawl, CTD rosette and vertical plankton tows. Data from the bottom trawl catch are used to monitor the distribution and abundance of fish and invertebrates throughout the Scotian Shelf, Bay of Fundy and Georges Bank.

### **Industry Survey and Maritimes Fishery Databases**  

#### ***Industry Survey Database (ISDB)***

Data use constraints: DFO INTERNAL USE ONLY

The Industry Survey Database (ISDB) is a departmental database containing at-sea fish catch observations from commercial fishing vessels operating in the Northwest Atlantic. Records can be associated with regular commercial fishing activities, or can represent industry-led scientific surveys. Industry surveys are not spatially or temporally synoptic and, therefore, integrating additional information on presence and/or habitat use (i.e., spawning, migration, feeding areas) from larger-scale studies is strongly recommended. Fisheries catch and effort information for an individual license holder is considered personal information and is protected under section 19 of the Access to Information Act (https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/page-5.html#h-12), and, for a corporate license holder, is considered to be sensitive, proprietary information and protected under Section 20 of the Access to Information Act (https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/page-5.html#h-13).

Without written consent, DFO is not permitted to release information or data products from ISDB (e.g., maps and data layers) that might reveal personal or third party information such as catch, landed values, and vessel-specific fishing locations, as this information is considered confidential. Information on privacy policy is available in the DFO staff informal release guidelines (i.e., Appendix B – “Catch and Effort and Quota Information: Do’s and Don’ts for Informal Release” (\\\\ent.dfo-mpo.ca\\ATLShares\\Shared\\ATIP Information\\Information_Release_Guidelines-eng.docx). If you are interested in including observer data in a publication, please remember to aggregate it (https://github.com/Maritimes/Mar.utils/blob/master/R/assess_privacy.r). 

#### ***The Maritime Fishery Information System (MARFIS)***

Data use constraints: DFO INTERNAL USE ONLY

The Maritimes Fishery Information System (MARFIS) is a DFO database, managed by the Policy & Economics Branch. MARFIS contains catch and effort, quota, and licensing information for the Maritimes Region. Log information for all commercial fisheries that land within this region is associated with this data. If a Maritimes Region commercial vessel makes landings in another DFO region or outside of Canadian waters, information is not included in the MARFIS database, irrespective of whether that vessel originated in Maritimes Region. The majority of catch information is related to commercial offloads i.e. dockside monitoring programs. Reported information contained within MARFIS is not considered spatially or temporally synoptic and, therefore, integrating additional information on presence and/or habitat use (i.e., spawning, migration, feeding) from larger-scale studies is strongly recommended. There is also more limited data related to discards and the Species At Risk data logs. Not all catch records have associated lat/long coordinates or information on fishing effort. However, generally all records are associated with a NAFO Division and NAFO Unit Area, even if no coordinates have been provided. Production data (<4 years old) are considered preliminary and subject to change without notice. Changes to archived data (>4 years old) may also occur but are generally limited. Ongoing qa/qc work is done on the MARFIS database, but not all errors are corrected. If you have data errors, questions, or corrections, you can send them to our data quality inbox: CDDDataQuality@dfo-mpo.gc.ca. This information about MARFIS was provided by Colin.O'Neil@dfo-mpo.gc.ca (July 2020, Policy & Economics Branch). If you are interested in including comercial catch data in a publication, please remember to aggregate it (https://github.com/Maritimes/Mar.utils/blob/master/R/assess_privacy.r).

OBIS is a global, open-access data and information clearing-house on marine biodiversity for science, conservation, and sustainable development [@OBIS]. Their vision is to build and maintain a global alliance that collaborates with scientific communities to facilitate free and open access to, and application of, biodiversity and biogeographic data and information on marine life. OBIS searches were conducted to find additional relevant records for species listed by SARA, or assessed by COSEWIC. Future iterations of this reporting tool will aim at expanding our quality checks of the OBIS database.

OCEARCH is a data-centric organization built to help scientists collect previously unattainable data in the ocean while open sourcing our research and explorations. Open sourcing and inclusion at every level, and in real-time, allows the world to participate in their projects while being aware of the developing science. OCEARCH shares the data, including samples collected and tracking data, with collaborating institutions and students who request them for their studies. The tracking data is also open-sourced to the public via the OCEARCH Tracker. The OCEARCH Tracker is a free app that lets you observe the navigational pattern of animals that have been tagged with satellite tracking technology. White Shark locations from satellite trackers are summarized in this section from 1 Jan 2013 to 31 Oct 2020. Locations were clipped to only include locations within the Canadian EEZ. A speed filter was run with 3 m/s as the maximum speed and 2.5 km as the potential error of locations. This filter removed approximately 100 locations out of of 2,000. Resulting points ere then visualized in ArcGIS to identify potential errors and remove locations that seemed implausible. Each shark location was individually plotted to do a second visual examination and to remove or flag errors/outliers. There is additional QA/QC that could still be performed to this dataset to capture additional issues (e.g. there may be single shark locations in Canadian waters during a period of time that the speed filter would not remove or that were not captured in the visual inspection). The absence of White Sharks in this section map should be interpreted as an absence of tracking data, not necessarily as an absence of the species in the area.
