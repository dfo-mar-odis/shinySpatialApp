Dataset description from the Open Data record [@OpenData_MAR_RV]: The Fisheries and Oceans Canada ecosystem Research Vessel (RV) surveys are conducted annually (since 1970) and are a source of integrated ecosystem monitoring data. These survey data are the primary data source for monitoring trends in species distribution, abundance, and biological condition within the region, and also provide data to the Atlantic Zonal Monitoring Program (AZMP) for monitoring hydrographic conditions, along with zooplankton and phytoplankton. The surveys follow a stratified random sampling design, and include sampling using a bottom otter trawl, CTD rosette and vertical plankton tows. Data from the bottom trawl catch are used to monitor the distribution and abundance of fish and invertebrates throughout the Scotian Shelf, Bay of Fundy and Georges Bank.

### **Industry Survey and Maritimes Fishery Databases**

The Industry Survey Database (ISDB) is a departmental database containing at-sea fish catch observations from commercial fishing vessels operating in the Northwest Atlantic. Industry surveys are not spatially or temporally synoptic and, therefore, integrating additional information on presence and/or habitat use (i.e., spawning, migration, feeding areas) from larger-scale studies is strongly recommended. Fisheries catch and effort information for an individual license holder is considered personal information and is protected under section 19 of the Access to Information Act (https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/page-5.html#h-12), and, for a corporate license holder, is considered to be sensitive, proprietary information and protected under Section 20 of the Access to Information Act (https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/page-5.html#h-13).

Without written consent, DFO is not permitted to release information or data products from ISDB (e.g., maps and data layers) that might reveal personal or third party information such as catch, landed values, and vessel-specific fishing locations, as this information is considered confidential. Information on privacy policy is available in the DFO staff informal release guidelines (i.e., Appendix B – “Catch and Effort and Quota Information: Do’s and Don’ts for Informal Release” (\\\\ent.dfo-mpo.ca\\ATLShares\\Shared\\ATIP Information\\Information_Release_Guidelines-eng.docx). If you are interested in including observer data in a publication, please remember to aggregate it (https://github.com/Maritimes/Mar.utils/blob/master/R/assess_privacy.r).

The Maritimes Fishery Information System (MARFIS) is a DFO database, managed by the Policy & Economics Branch. MARFIS contains catch and effort, quota, and licensing information for the Maritimes Region. Log information for all commercial fisheries that land within this region is associated with this data. If a Maritimes Region commercial vessel makes landings in another DFO region or outside of Canadian waters, information is not included in the MARFIS database, irrespective if that vessel originated in the Maritimes Region. The majority of catch information is related to commercial offloads. Reported information contained within MARFIS is not considered spatially or temporally synoptic and, therefore, integrating additional information on presence and/or habitat use (i.e., spawning, migration, feeding) from larger-scale studies is strongly recommended. There is also more limited data related to discards and the Species At Risk data logs. Not all catch records have associated lat/long coordinates. Depending on the structure or completeness of the log, some records may not have associated geographic coordinates. However, generally all records are associated with a NAFO Division and NAFO Unit Area, even if no coordinates have been provided. Production data (<4 years old) are considered preliminary and subject to change without notice. Changes to archived data (>4 years old) may also occur but are generally limited. Ongoing qa/qc work is done on the MARFIS database, but not all errors are corrected. If you have data errors, questions, or corrections, you can send them to our data quality inbox: CDDDataQuality@dfo-mpo.gc.ca. This information about MARFIS was provided by Colin.O'Neil@dfo-mpo.gc.ca (July 2020, Policy & Economics Branch). If you are interested in including observer data in a publication, please remember to aggregate it (https://github.com/Maritimes/Mar.utils/blob/master/R/assess_privacy.r).

OBIS is a global, open-access data and information clearing-house on marine biodiversity for science, conservation, and sustainable development [@OBIS]. Their vision is to build and maintain a global alliance that collaborates with scientific communities to facilitate free and open access to, and application of, biodiversity and biogeographic data and information on marine life. OBIS searches were conducted to find additional relevant records for species listed by SARA, assessed by COSEWIC, or included in the Wild Species listing. Future iterations of this reporting tool will aim at expanding our quality checks of the OBIS database.
