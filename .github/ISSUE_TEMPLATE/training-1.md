### Action:
Clone the shiny app and install all the dependencies.  Here's the loose help guide I made for this: https://086gc-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/quentin_stoyel_dfo-mpo_gc_ca/ETa4YB3BEDVJrDT4BScj80oBJgF1I-kHe8bLTJbqyb2qDQ?e=llP8nM 

### Context:
It's good to install everything at once and R is a little tricky for dependencies.  

### Effort:
5.  Depending on how much trouble this gives you, definitely reach out if you get stuck on anything for more than 5 minutes.
