### Action:
Clone the shiny app and install all the dependencies.  Here's the loose help guide I made for this: https://github.com/dfo-mar-odis/shinySpatialApp/wiki/Cloning-the-Repository-Instructions

### Context:
It's good to install everything at once and R is a little tricky for dependencies.  

### Effort:
5.  Depending on how much trouble this gives you, definitely reach out if you get stuck on anything for more than 5 minutes.
