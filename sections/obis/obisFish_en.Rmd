OBIS is a global, open-access data and information clearing-house on marine biodiversity for science, conservation, and sustainable development [@OBIS]. Their vision is to build and maintain a global alliance that collaborates with scientific communities to facilitate free and open access to, and application of, biodiversity and biogeographic data and information on marine life. OBIS searches were conducted to find additional relevant records for species listed by SARA, or assessed by COSEWIC. Future iterations of this reporting tool will aim at expanding our quality checks of the OBIS database.
